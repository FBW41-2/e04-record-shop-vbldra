# Data Server - Record Shop Workshops

This repo hosts a series of workshops on creating a traditional RESTfull API using Node, Express and Mongoose. The workshops are following DCI's curriculum structure. A basic reference on how we move in our project is this series of tutorials by [Academind](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL55RiY5tL51q4D-B63KBnygU6opNPFk_q). Please bookmark the video playlist for future reference. :crystal_ball:

## The way it works

This repo has several branches with several stages of the development of the final app. For each stage, a list of changes will be added to the [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) file, to explain the changes made.

If you need a reminder on how this app changed through each of the workshops, simply checkout the branch for the phase you are interested in, and read the changelog.

In addition, branches with the prefix task/ describe the task that needs to be achieved in that change. The tasks are all listed in the TASKS.md file. If you want to start doing things yourself, simply checkout the task branch and make the change. To begin from the start, checkout the task/01-mock-database-and-controllers branch.
